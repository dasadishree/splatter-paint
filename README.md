# Splatter Paint Project
used hackclub workshop https://workshops.hackclub.com/splatter_paint/ to create, took about an hour!
never really used HTML to make anything like this (usually my HTML projects are not very interactive)

# stuff i added myself
- sounds
- changed distance between shapes
- attempted to add rectangle
- colors
